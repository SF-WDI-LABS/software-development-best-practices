# ToDo

* Integrate parts of https://github.com/ga-wdi-lessons/agile
* Integrate Trello example
* Update formatting
* Integrate more interactive activities
* Discuss extreme programming
* expand TDD section
* Reorder sections/integrate challenges throughout
* me more specific about user stories challenge
* Discuss information chain: client -> user story -> test -> code 
* Agile is dead? (not an excuse to be unplanned) continuous integration is another movement inspired by agile.
* Discuss point system

# Development Best Practices

## Why is this important?
<!-- framing the "why" in big-picture/real world examples -->
*This workshop is important because:*

Well-planned projects with flexible processes are more enjoyable to work on and turn out better. In the following workshop we will discuss how to plan appropriately and follow some best practices.

## What are the objectives?
<!-- specific/measurable goal for students to achieve -->
*After this workshop, developers will be able to:*

- Compare and contrast several development methodologies
- Define features as user stories
- Design mockups to inform the UI/UX

## Where should we be now?
<!-- call out the skills that are prerequisites -->
*Before this workshop, developers should already be able to:*

* Have projects in the planning phase

##Waterfall Methodology

Waterfall is a good example of a linear methodology in which the project's progress steady flows down from one team to another. It's "easy" manage due to the rigidity of the model.

## Agile Methodology

_Agile software development is a group of software development methods in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change_- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

The Agile Manifesto is a formal "proclamation" of key values for approaching software development put together in 2001. Let's discuss its core 12 principles:

* Our highest priority is to **satisfy the customer**
through early and **continuous delivery
of valuable software**.

* **Welcome changing requirements**, even late in 
development. Agile processes harness change for 
the customer's competitive advantage.

* **Deliver working software frequently**, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
preference to the shorter timescale.

* Business people and developers must **work 
together** daily throughout the project.

* Build projects around **motivated individuals**. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the job done.

* The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is **face-to-face conversation**.

* **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.

* Agile processes promote **sustainable development**. 
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

* Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and **good design** enhances agility.

* **Simplicity**--the art of maximizing the amount 
of work not done--is essential.

* The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
emerge from **self-organizing teams**.

* At regular intervals, the team **reflects on how 
to become more effective**, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.


## Best practices

###Satisfy the Customer

* **User stories** define the features an application will provide in a simple and concise way.

* **Wireframes** define the structural UI of the application.

###Deliver Working Software

* **Pair programming** is development technique in which two programmers work on a specific problem together.

* **Test-driven development** improves code design and quality.

##Work Together

* **Scrum meetings** are short meetings used to plan, review, and increase accountability and clarity across a team. Examples include sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review and retrospective, and **STAND UPS**.

* **Retrospectives**

## User Stories

A user *(specified type optional)* can [GOAL], *so that [PURPOSE]*

For example:

- _A user can read reviews of a book (so that they are better informed when making a purchase)._
- _An admin can update the inventory of a book so that the buyers know what is available._

* Add sprints, trello

* velocity tracking

> Individually, create four user stories that apply to the functionality for your favorite app or website, following the format above and assign each a specific point value.

## Wireframes

_A website wireframe, also known as a **page schematic** or **screen blueprint**, is a visual guide that represents the **skeletal framework** of a **website**._ - Wikipedia

[...continued...] **Wireframes** are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. The purpose is usually being informed by a business objective and a creative idea. The wireframe depicts the **page layout** or **arrangement** of the websiteâ€™s **content**, including **interface elements** and **navigational systems**, and how they work together. The wireframe usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main focus lies in **functionality**, behavior, and priority of content.

The key points to get across when creating a wireframe are:

* Information design
* Navigation design
* Interface design

#### An example of a wireframe

Let's look at the difference between YouTube's page for a particular video and how a wireframe compares:

</p>

Wireframes focus on:

* The range of functions available
* The relative priorities of the information and functions
* The rules for displaying certain kinds of information
* The effect of different scenarios on the display

##Pair Programming

One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

Pair programming is a proven way to get a team to knowledge-share while producing higher-quality, more maintable code.

- Compare agile development to waterfall development.
- What are users stories and why are they used?
- What are wireframes and why are they used?
